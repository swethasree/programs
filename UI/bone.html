“Some people think it’s safe to give dogs large bones, like those from a ham or a roast,” 
says Dr. Carmela Stamper, a veterinarian in the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine. 
“Bones are unsafe no matter what their size. Giving your dog a bone may make your pet 
a candidate for a trip to your veterinarian’s office later, possible emergency surgery,
 or even death.”
